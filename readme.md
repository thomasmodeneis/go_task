## Problem 

Write a function: `func Solution(A []int) int` that, given an array A consisting of N integers, where A[K] denotes the height
of the K-th tree, returns the number of ways of cutting out one tree, so that the remaining trees are aesthetically pleasing. If it is not possible to
achieve the desired result, your function should return âˆ’1. If the trees are
already aesthetically pleasing without any removal, your function should return 0.
